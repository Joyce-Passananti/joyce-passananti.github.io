          <h1>Little Tracks, Big Heart</h1>
          <a>Little Tracks, Big Heart is an exploration of how video games can be designed to help educate and encourage 
            activism from players, while maintaining the fun and rewarding aspects of gaming. Video games have rapidly 
            become integrated in almost every part of society- from educational uses to therapy to career options, and have 
            the potential for so much more. I'm personally very passionate about environmental awareness, and thought it 
            would be an interesting endeavor to create a game that incorporates current issues into the gameplay, followed 
            by an option for players to enact real change. To do so, I designed and created several levels using Unity 
            3D that address certain environmental challenges, and upon completion of each level the player is directed 
            to a relevant cause on change.org. In this way players can become aware of issues, invested in them, and then 
            active in the solution- whether it's signing a petition, sharing on social media, or making a donation to a cause.

          <h1>TaskMapper</h1>
          <a>TaskMapper aims to help students with managing both personal tasks and academic assignments by providing a platform 
            to track and incentivize work completion with meditative exploration. The browser based platform/game allows users to 
            optimally track their tasks through a consolidated list that includes assignments and exams automatically imported from Canvas, 
            <!-- (the primary course management tool used by high schools + universities),  -->
            with the option to modify and add as needed. The task list will be paired with a meditative world such that the 
            user can unlock more areas to explore by completing tasks, and the world will contain varying breathing and meditative 
            exercises to allow users to stay focused and relaxed while working. The platform was built with a React framework alongside a-frame and javascript, and uses 
            the Canvas API. This project is currently published <a href="https://tootiredtobeinspired.netlify.app/" target="_blank">here</a>, 
            and the codebase is located at our <a href="https://github.com/rajanisamir/tttbi" target="_blank">github repo</a>. Feel free to check it out!

          <h1>Global Goals</h1>
          <a>Global Goals is a project I collaborated on with Daria Schifrina for Venus Hacks 2021 which won <b>Best Hack for Social Good</b>. 
            The project devpost can be accessed <a target="_blank" href="https://lnkd.in/e3SdugD">here</a>, and we have a 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://lnkd.in/eMtZ8gj">YouTube walkthrough</a> for it as well. It's a browser-based game hosted 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://lnkd.in/eV6UC9U">here</a> that encourages social activism through a community-oriented app 
            that enables players to grow an oasis of animals by engaging in social justice work. To earn rewards, players can donate to 
            non-profit organizations, share causes on social media, and sign petitions. Our project is hosted on Replit, uses Python, 
            Flask, SQLite. All graphics were proudly designed and drawn by us!

          <h1>Eyes Free Mobile App</h1>
          <a>This research project focused on examining mobile services available to the visually impaired community,
            and culminated in an <a href="https://github.com/Joyce-Passananti/eyes-free-app" target="_blank">application</a> + 
            <a href="../assets/projects/Mobile_Computing_Paper.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> describing our research process, app development, 
            and study findings. Our solution took shape as a centralized, eyes-free application to help blind or low-vision individuals accomplish 
            many of their day-to-day needs. For dev/evaluation we used the Expo platform and React Native framework, using 
            libraries and sensors compatible with both Android and iOS: the microphone, accelerometer, and camera. Our backend 
            is set up with Google Cloud, leveraging Google Cloud APIs for object identification, speech-to-text, text recognition, and text-to-speech.

          <h1>ML Teaching App</h1>
          <a>This research project was the end product of an internship in the Micrsoft Research CHIL group to make machine teaching 
            more accessible to everyone, not just to machine learning experts. Teaching for machine learning requires humans to put what 
            they know into a computer, often a time-consuming task- what if a there was a way to help that human do it 
            in small bites? We developed an app that allows users to easily create and train their own machine learning model to classify their data into categories to 
            organize and personalize their information flow. After performing a competitive analysis of services already 
            available, we designed and developed this mobile application to improve upon existing products while incorporating 
            new services using Expo, React Native, and Typescript/C#. Here is a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVHXWP3fS0k">video</a>

          <h1>Music Gallery</h1>
          <a>An <a target="_blank" href="https://joyce-passananti.github.io/Music_Gallery/">immersive experience</a>
             that plays around with generated music and art through many outlets. 
            For pre-generated songs I used RunwayML to style transfer the photos using various models, and generated the jukebox 
            tracks with pretrained models as well. The "generate song" page produces a custom track each time and uses tone.js, 
            while the "create song" page allows a user to interact with a keyboard model to test and record their own song. Overall 
            this was just a casual exploration of computer/ai-generated music that is definitely unpolished, but fun to play around 
            with and fun to make! *a-frame is supported best by firefox and takes a few minutes to load all assets*

          <h1>ALice In Wonderland Escape Room</h1>
          <a>I was inspired by all the challenges in Alice and Wonderland, so decided to create an escape-room type game, but in VR. 
          The world was created using a-frame + models availble on turbosquid. The player sees through the perspective of Alice, and is 
          prompted to follow a white rabbit to the base of a tree where you then fall down the rabbithole and are transported to wonderland.
          Except you're stuck in a room, surrounded by strange objects, and a locked door seems to be the only way out. You can find it

          <h1>Global Goals</h1>
          <a>Global Goals is a project I collaborated on with Daria Schifrina for Venus Hacks 2021 which won Best Hack for Social Good. 
            The project devpost can be accessed <a target="_blank" href="https://lnkd.in/e3SdugD">here</a>, and we have a 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://lnkd.in/eMtZ8gj">youTube walkthrough</a> for it as well. It's a browser-based game hosted 
            <a target="_blank" href="https://lnkd.in/eV6UC9U">here</a> that encourages social activism through a community-oriented app 
            that enables players to grow an oasis of animals by engaging in social justice work. To earn rewards, players can donate to 
            non-profit organizations, share causes on social media, and sign petitions. Our project is hosted on Replit, uses Python, 
            Flask, SQLite. All graphics were proudly designed and drawn by us!

          <h1>Eyes Free Mobile App</h1>
          <a>This research project focused on examining mobile services available to the visually impaired community,
            and culminated in an <a href="https://github.com/Joyce-Passananti/eyes-free-app" target="_blank">application</a> + 
            <a href="../assets/projects/Mobile_Computing_Paper.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> describing our research process, app development, 
            and study findings. Our solution took shape as a centralized, eyes-free application to help blind or low-vision individuals accomplish 
            many of their day-to-day needs. For dev/evaluation we used the Expo platform and React Native framework, using 
            libraries and sensors compatible with both Android and iOS: the microphone, accelerometer, and camera. Our backend 
            is set up with Google Cloud, leveraging Google Cloud APIs for object identification, speech-to-text, text recognition, and text-to-speech.

          <h1>Music Gallery</h1>
          <a>An <a target="_blank" href="https://joyce-passananti.github.io/Music_Gallery/">immersive experience</a>
             that plays around with generated music and art through many outlets. 
            For pre-generated songs I used RunwayML to style transfer the photos using various models, and generated the jukebox 
            tracks with pretrained models as well. The "generate song" page produces a custom track each time and uses tone.js, 
            while the "create song" page allows a user to interact with a keyboard model to test and record their own song. Overall 
            this was just a casual exploration of computer/ai-generated music that is definitely unpolished, but fun to play around 
            with and fun to make! *a-frame is supported best by firefox and takes a few minutes to load all assets*

          <h1>ALice In Wonderland Escape Room</h1>
          <a>I was inspired by all the challenges in Alice and Wonderland, so decided to create an escape-room type game, but in VR. 
          The world was created using a-frame + models availble on turbosquid. The player sees through the perspective of Alice, and is 
          prompted to follow a white rabbit to the base of a tree where you then fall down the rabbithole and are transported to wonderland.
          Except you're stuck in a room, surrounded by strange objects, and a locked door seems to be the only way out. You can find it
          <a target="_blank" href="https://joyce-passananti.github.io/WonderlandEscapeRoom/">here</a> or watch a quick
          <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/y3C0XeUVNgY">video of gameplay</a> in the browser!

          <b>Thermal Router</b>
          <li>A fusion360 add-on that helps anyone, regardless of prior experience or expertise, design thermally sound devices. 
            Example designs we identified as relevant and focused on included 3D printed watch cases, wearable heaters, and raspberry pi cases. A user can choose to 
            either augment their design with conductive material, increase airflow through holes in chosen surfaces, or add on a customized silicone to disperse 
            heat from sources that would otherwise be at risk of overheating. </li> 
            <li>My contributions included helping design the tool through many iterations, scripting significant portions of the addon in python after extensive research 
              of the Fusion360 API, and running a large-scale user study + analyzing results.</li>
              <li>Our paper is aimed for publication in UIST 2023.</li>
            <!--  While I had prior experience with python and different CAD programs, writing a 
            script to manipulate an unknown design: considering the geometry, simulating heat flow through 
            the object, designing multiple solutions to distribute heat efficiently and cost-effectively, and 
            calculating the best result was a considerable challenge. The addon works on top of the program 
            and can thus be applied to anyone's design; examples we identified as relevant and focused on 
            included 3D printed watch cases, wearable heaters, and raspberry pi cases. A user can choose to 
            either augment their design with conductive material, increase airflow through holes in chosen 
            surfaces, or add on a customized silicone to disperse heat from sources that would otherwise be at 
            risk of overheating. Automating these solutions so that an inexperienced user can easily optimize 
            their design further required a simple and intuitive interface, which proved to be a learning 
            exercise in testing and incorporating user feedback. Following the tool's completion, I designed and 
            conducted the user research study from start to finish. I reached out across many platforms to find 
            study participants with a variety of backgrounds and ran the study over zoom, using multiple 
            computers with remote user control to simulate as real an experience as possible. I summarized the 
            findings to my team, analyzing the results and noting critical feedback, which we then discussed 
            and presented in our paper. Through this experience I acquired many new skills in both the 
            technical and management realms and demonstrated my ability to learn quickly and adapt well in 
            new or unfamiliar situations.-->

          <a>My main project has been ThermalRouter, a program enabling CAD novices and hobbyists to design thermally sound devices with the aid of our 
            Fusion360 add-on that culminated in a research paper submitted to CHI 2022. I worked on the design and implementation of this feature which 
            involved extensive python scripting and use of the Fusion360 API, then proceeded to run and analyze a user study to draw conclusions for our paper.

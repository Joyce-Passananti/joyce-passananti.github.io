          <h2>Dec 2020 - Present</h2>
          <a>My main project has been ThermalRouter, a program enabling CAD novices and hobbyists to design thermally sound devices with the aid of our 
            Fusion360 add-on that culminated in a research paper submitted to CHI 2022. I worked on the design and implementation of this feature which 
            involved extensive python scripting and use of the Fusion360 API, then proceeded to run and analyze a user study to draw conclusions for our paper.
            Currently working on an open-source tool + resource-library to facilitate reuse of electronic components in designing new devices and reduce e-waste

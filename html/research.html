          <h3>SculptAR: Direct Manipulations of Machine Toolpaths in Augmented Reality for 3D Clay Printing</h3>
          <ul><b>Joyce Passananti</b>, Ana Cardenas, Jennifer Jacobs, Tobias Hollerer</ul>
          <ul><i>UIST Demo Track 2023</i></ul>
          <ul>With SculptAR we seek to support fabrication workflows where clay
            artists can previsualize and dimension their vessel in the fabrication context and manipulate the shape textures and forms created
            by these toolpaths in an immersive 3D context. By visualizing
            the machine toolpath directly, we allow clay artists to leverage
            their unique knowledge and experience of the material to design
            structurally sound vessels. </ul>

          <ul><i>IEEE VR 2023</i></ul>
          <ul>Dynamically adjusting the content of augmented reality (AR) applications to efficiently display information best fitting the available
            screen estate may be important for user performance and satisfaction. We present a
            Level-of-Detail AR mechanism to improve the usability of AR applications at any relative size. Our mechanism dynamically renders
            textual and interactable content based on its legibility, interactability, and viewability respectively.</ul>

          <ul>We created a CAD plugin that assists users with to improve the thermal performance of their models. ThermalRouter automatically converts regions of the model to be
            made from thermally-conductive materials (such as nylon or metallic-silicone). The key is that ThermalRouter automatically simulates the thermal
            performance of many possible heat channel configurations and presents the user with the most thermally-sound design

          <ul><i>UIST 2023</i></ul>
          <ul>We present an interactive tool that enables electronics designers to explore recycling electronic components during the design
            process. We accomplish this via (1) creating suggestions to assist users in identifying and designing with recycled
            components; and (2) maintaining a library of useful data relevant to reuse (e.g., allowing users to find which devices
            contain which components).</ul>

          <a>My main project has been ThermalRouter, a program enabling CAD novices and hobbyists to design thermally sound devices with the aid of our 
            Fusion360 add-on that culminated in a research paper submitted to CHI 2022. I worked on the design and implementation of this feature which 
            involved extensive python scripting and use of the Fusion360 API, then proceeded to run and analyze a user study to draw conclusions for our paper.

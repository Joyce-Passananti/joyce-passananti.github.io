          <h2>about</h2>
          <a>Hello, I'm Joyce! I'm currently completing my PhD in Human-Computer-Interaction at UCSB, after having recently 
           graduated from the University of Chicago with a BS in computer science and BA in media art & design. 
           I'm passionate about doing research in HCI and related areas and enjoy game design/dev as a hobby. 
           <!-- The intersection of programming and art excites me, and in my free time I like to explore new ways of creating. -->

            <h1 >Little Tracks, Big Heart</h1>
            <b>Unity3D, environmental activism</b><br>
            <a>Little Tracks, Big Heart is an exploration of how video games can be designed to help educate and encourage 
              activism from players, while maintaining the fun and rewarding aspects of gaming. Video games have rapidly 
              become integrated in almost every part of society- from educational uses to therapy to career options, and have 
              the potential for so much more. I'm personally very passionate about environmental awareness, and thought it 
              would be an interesting endeavor to create a game that incorporates current issues into the gameplay, followed 
              by an option for players to enact real change. To do so, I designed and created several levels using Unity 
              3D that address certain environmental challenges, and upon completion of each level the player is directed 
              to a relevant cause on change.org. In this way players can become aware of issues, invested in them, and then 
              active in the solution- whether it's signing a petition, sharing on social media, or making a donation to a cause.

            <h1>Global Goals</h1>
            <b>Game dev, social justice</b><br>
            <a >Global Goals is a project I collaborated on with Daria Schifrina for Venus Hacks 2021 which won <b>Best Hack for Social Good</b>. 
              The project devpost can be accessed <a target="_blank" href="https://lnkd.in/e3SdugD">here</a>, and we have a 
              <a target="_blank" href="https://lnkd.in/eMtZ8gj">YouTube walkthrough</a> for it as well. It's a browser-based game hosted 
              <a target="_blank" href="https://lnkd.in/eV6UC9U">here</a> that encourages social activism through a community-oriented app 
              that enables players to grow an oasis of animals by engaging in social justice work. To earn rewards, players can donate to 
              non-profit organizations, share causes on social media, and sign petitions. Our project is hosted on Replit, uses Python, 
              Flask, SQLite. All graphics were proudly designed and drawn by us!

            <h1>Eyes Free Mobile App</h1>
            <b>Mobile app, accessibility</b><br>
            <a>This research project focused on examining mobile services available to the visually impaired community,
              and culminated in an <a href="https://github.com/Joyce-Passananti/eyes-free-app" target="_blank">application</a> + 
              <a href="../assets/projects/Mobile_Computing_Paper.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> describing our research process, app development, 
              and study findings. Our solution took shape as a centralized, eyes-free application to help blind or low-vision individuals accomplish 
              many of their day-to-day needs. For dev/evaluation we used the Expo platform and React Native framework, using 
              libraries and sensors compatible with both Android and iOS: the microphone, accelerometer, and camera. Our backend 
              is set up with Google Cloud, leveraging Google Cloud APIs for object identification, speech-to-text, text recognition, and text-to-speech.

          <h2>Projects</h2>
          <p>Over the past few years I've become very excited about game design & dev! I've also built up various web + app dev skills 
            though personal projects and work and decided to build this website from scratch to touch up on those skills.
            Check out some other cool projects I've worked on for research interests, hackathons, class, or just for fun!

          <h2>Experience</h2>
          <p>I'm interested in HCI research and am currently a Graduate Student Researcher in the Four Eyes Lab at UCSB. I've 
            spent the past few summers developing my programming and project management skills through SWE internships at Microsoft. 
            Since high school I've enjoyed teaching cs + engineering as a tutor, programming instructor, and workshop leader. 
            It's also important to me to be involved in my community through community service, volunteering, 
            and leadership. Find out more about my previous (& current!) experiences here!</p>

          <h2>Art</h2>
          <p>I love making things in my free time- most recently I've been experimenting with fabrication as a tool for creating art.
            Some of my other passions include algorithmic art and pottery (yet to be photographed). Check out my art portfolio here!

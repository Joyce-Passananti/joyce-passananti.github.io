          <h3>Hello, I'm Joyce! I'm currently completing my PhD in Human-Computer-Interaction at UCSB, after having recently 
           graduated from the University of Chicago with a BS in computer science and BA in media art & design. 
           I'm passionate about doing research in HCI and related areas and enjoy game design/dev as a hobby. 
           <!-- The intersection of programming and art excites me, and in my free time I like to explore new ways of creating. -->

          <h2>Projects</h2>
          <p>Over the past few years I've become very excited about game design & dev! I've also built up various web + app dev skills 
            though personal projects and work and decided to build this website from scratch to touch up on those skills.
            Check out some other cool projects I've worked on for research interests, hackathons, class, or just for fun!

          <h2>Experience</h2>
          <p>I'm interested in HCI research and am currently a Graduate Student Researcher in the Four Eyes Lab at UCSB. I've 
            spent the past few summers developing my programming and project management skills through SWE internships at Microsoft. 
            Since high school I've enjoyed teaching cs + engineering as a tutor, programming instructor, and workshop leader. 
            It's also important to me to be involved in my community through community service, volunteering, 
            and leadership. Find out more about my previous (& current!) experiences here!</p>

        <div class="art-overview">
          <h2>Art</h2>
          <p>I love making things in my free time- most recently I've been experimenting with fabrication as a tool for creating art.
            Some of my other passions include algorithmic art and pottery (yet to be photographed). Check out my art portfolio here!

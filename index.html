          <h2>about me</h2>
          <a>Hello, I'm Joyce! I'm a third year CS PhD student at the University of California, Santa Barbara doing research in Human Computer Interaction, with a focus on 
            mixed reality and computational design + fabrication. I completed my undergraduate at the University of Chicago with a BS in Computer Science (HCI Specialization) and BA in Media Art & Design (game development + design specialization). 
            <br> <br>
            My research has been supported by the <b>NSF GRFP</b>, UCSB's <b>Academic Excellence Fellowship</b> and <b>Graduate Research Mentorship Program Fellowship</b> awards as well as the University of Chicago <b>Metcalf Grant</b> and <b>
            Green Fund Grant</b> for HCI Research. I'm interested in exploring creative opportunities in digital fabrication, and enjoy game design + development as a hobby.
            <!-- In my free time I love to sail, hike, do ceramics, and take my cat for walks. -->

      <h1>Research </h1>
      <h4>AR/VR | Computational Fabrication | Creativity Support </h4>
      <a> I'm currently doing mixed reality and computational design research in the  <a class="website" target="_blank" href="http://ilab.cs.ucsb.edu/">Four Eyes Lab</a> 
        and <a class="website" target="_blank" href="https://ecl.mat.ucsb.edu/">Expressive Computation Lab</a>, advised by 
        <a class="website" target="_blank" href="https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~holl/">Prof. Tobias Hollerer</a>. 
        Prior to my PhD I worked as a Research Assistant (under Prof. Pedro Lopes) in the <a class="website" target="_blank" href="http://lab.plopes.org/">
        Human-Computer Interaction Lab</a> at the University of Chicago, where I discovered my passion for human centered design
        and cultivated critical research skills. 
        <br> <br>
        My current research is in creativity support- collaborating directly with artists to use technology to
        further creative possibilities in their crafts. I'm interested in discovering the value/benefits mixed reality can provide for
        visualization, direct manipulation, and skill development for artists. A unique approach I plan to explore is how
        systems can not only be designed to support artists in collaboration, as tools, but also how they can benefit human
        capabilities by helping develop human skills that will be retained even once technology is removed from the environment.
        <br/><br>
        My past research has included accessibility design and application, computational fabrication, and 
        developing programs to lower the knowledge barrier for utilizing complex design technology. Projects I've dedicated significant amounts of time too have focused on 
        aiding the visually impaired community as well as making creative technologies more accessible to the general population. 
        I have a strong desire to learn new skills and branch out to discover other areas in which technology can support creativity and growth.</a>

      <h1>Featured Projects</h1>
      <a>In addition to my research I enjoy being creative and working on various projects, specifically in the domain of game design & development.
        I've polished my web + app development skills though personal projects and work and decided to build this website from scratch to touch up on those skills.
        Check out some other cool projects I've worked on for research interests, hackathons, class, or just for fun! I've also linked my

            <h1 >Little Tracks, Big Heart</h1>
            <b>Unity3D, environmental activism</b><br><br>
            <a>Little Tracks, Big Heart is an exploration of how video games can be designed to help educate and encourage 
              activism from players, while maintaining the fun and rewarding aspects of gaming. Video games have rapidly 
              become integrated in almost every part of society- from educational uses to therapy to career options, and have 
              the potential for so much more. I'm personally very passionate about environmental awareness, and thought it 
              would be an interesting endeavor to create a game that incorporates current issues into the gameplay, followed 
              by an option for players to enact real change. To do so, I designed and created several levels using Unity 
              3D that address certain environmental challenges, and upon completion of each level the player is directed 
              to a relevant cause on change.org. In this way players can become aware of issues, invested in them, and then 
              active in the solution- whether it's signing a petition, sharing on social media, or making a donation to a cause.

            <a >Global Goals is a project I collaborated on with Daria Schifrina for Venus Hacks 2021 which won <b>Best Hack for Social Good</b>. 
              The project devpost can be accessed <a target="_blank" href="https://lnkd.in/e3SdugD">here</a>, and we have a 
              <a target="_blank" href="https://lnkd.in/eMtZ8gj">YouTube walkthrough</a> for it as well. It's a browser-based game hosted 
              <a target="_blank" href="https://lnkd.in/eV6UC9U">here</a> that encourages social activism through a community-oriented app 
              that enables players to grow an oasis of animals by engaging in social justice work. To earn rewards, players can donate to 
              non-profit organizations, share causes on social media, and sign petitions. Our project is hosted on Replit, uses Python, 
              Flask, SQLite. All graphics were proudly designed and drawn by us!

            <h1>Eyes Free Mobile App</h1>
            <b>Mobile app, accessibility</b><br><br>
            <a>This research project focused on examining mobile services available to the visually impaired community,
              and culminated in an <a href="https://github.com/Joyce-Passananti/eyes-free-app" target="_blank">application</a> + 
              <a href="../assets/projects/Mobile_Computing_Paper.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> describing our research process, app development, 
              and study findings. Our solution took shape as a centralized, eyes-free application to help blind or low-vision individuals accomplish 
              many of their day-to-day needs. For dev/evaluation we used the Expo platform and React Native framework, using 
              libraries and sensors compatible with both Android and iOS: the microphone, accelerometer, and camera. Our backend 
              is set up with Google Cloud, leveraging Google Cloud APIs for object identification, speech-to-text, text recognition, and text-to-speech.

          <h2>Experience</h2>
          <p>I'm interested in HCI research and am currently a Graduate Student Researcher in the Four Eyes Lab at UCSB. I've 
            spent the past few summers developing my programming and project management skills through SWE internships at Microsoft. 
            Since high school I've enjoyed teaching cs + engineering as a tutor, programming instructor, and workshop leader. 
            It's also important to me to be involved in my community through community service, volunteering, 
            and leadership. Find out more about my previous (& current!) experiences here!</p>

          <p>I love making things in my free time- most recently I've been experimenting with fabrication as a tool for creating art.
            Some of my other passions include algorithmic art and pottery (yet to be photographed). Check out my art portfolio here!
